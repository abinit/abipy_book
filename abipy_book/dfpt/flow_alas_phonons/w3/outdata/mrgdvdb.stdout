 ==== Info on the dvdb% object ====
DVDB version: 2
File path: /Users/gmatteo/git_repos/abitutorials/abitutorials/dfpt/flow_alas_phonons/w3/outdata/out_DVDB
Number of v1scf potentials: 2
Number of q-points in DVDB: 1
Activate symmetrization of v1scf(r): no
List of q-points:
[ 1 ] [ 5.0000E-01,  5.0000E-01,  0.0000E+00]
qpoint: [ 5.0000E-01,  5.0000E-01,  0.0000E+00] is present in the DVDB file
 The list of irreducible perturbations for this q vector is:
    1)  idir= 1, ipert=   1, type=independent, found=Yes
    2)  idir= 2, ipert=   1, type=symmetric, found=No
    3)  idir= 3, ipert=   1, type=symmetric, found=No
    4)  idir= 1, ipert=   2, type=independent, found=Yes
    5)  idir= 2, ipert=   2, type=symmetric, found=No
    6)  idir= 3, ipert=   2, type=symmetric, found=No

All the independent perturbations are available
 Done
