 no comparison between the current and input DDB information

--- !COMMENT
src_file: mblktyp1.F90
src_line: 206
message: |
    No comparison/check is performed for the current and input DDB information because argument --nostrict was passed to the command line. Use at your own risk !
...

 Will try to merge this input DDB with the current one.
 Current number of bloks =    1
 Will read     1 blocks from the input DDB
 Now, current number of bloks =    2
 All DDBs have been read
 check the equality of blocks, and eventually merge
 merge block #    2 to block #    1
     1 blocks are merged; the new DDB will have      1 blocks.
 open the output database, write the preliminary information
 write the DDB
 Write bloc number   1
 Bloc number   2 was merged, so do not write it
