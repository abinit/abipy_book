```{note}
Simple visualization tasks can be easily automated by just issuing in the terminal:

    abiopen.py FILE --expose

to generate a predefined list of **matplotlib** plots.
To activate the plotly version (if available) use:

    abiopen.py FILE --plotly

Note also that one can generate jupyter-lab notebooks directly from the command line with
{{ abiopen }} and the command:

    abiopen.py FILE -nb

Add `--classic-notebook` if you prefer classic jupyter notebooks.

Finally, use one of the options of the {{ abiview  }} script to plot the results automatically.
```
